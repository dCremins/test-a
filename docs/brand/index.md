# Branding and Assets

To maintain a consistent institute brand, ITRE logos and templates should be used for all institute materials.

If there is no pre-created template or logo available which meets your needs, the following guidelines can be used to match the existing ITRE brand.

## NC State University

As an institute within NC State University, any of the approved NCSU branding can be used in ITRE materials in place of the ITRE branding. The ITRE logo should still be included in the work when possible. More information on NCSU branding standards can be found on the [NC State Branding Page](https://brand.ncsu.edu)
